## Description
This site was built as a tool for the user to find events in their area, and popular breweries in the area. The user is able to enter a city name into the search modal and once the search button or the enter key is pressed, the site will fetch and display popular events in the area from the Ticketmaster API on the right side of the page, at the same time as the popular brewerys being displayed on the left side of the page.
